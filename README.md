## 🧭 Introduction

**Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** is a discipline that combines software engineering and operations to build scalable, reliable, and highly available systems.  
Originally developed at Google, SRE introduces concepts such as **SLIs, SLOs, error budgets, automation, monitoring, and eliminating toil**.

This repository aims to give beginners a structured and practical learning path into SRE.
